This repository contains all the data and scripts needed to reproduce the results of the manuscript: The effects of climate on bat morphology across space and time (https://doi.org/10.1002/ecog.07663).

Scripts are organized to replicate the analysis presented in the manuscript. The scripts are divided into spatial and temporal analyses:

Spatial Analysis: These scripts include environmental variables and analyze spatial patterns in bat morphology.
Temporal Analysis: These scripts focus on how bat body size changes over time without incorporating environmental variables.
Each script is divided into two sections:

"FAL dataset": Refers to the analyses performed with the main FAL data, including all the forearm length measurements.
"Pairwise_FAL_BM dataset": Refers to the analyses performed with the pairwise_FAL_BM data, which includes both FAL and BM records.
Some scripts include code to reproduce the figures presented in the manuscript.
